About:  On my journey of learning Basic programming on my Commodore 64 I came
across the book "Creating Advenutures on your Commodore 64" by Clive Gifford
and Robert Young.  I thought this was a great starting point.

The D64 in this repository has the Dark Forest adventure typed in as close to possible to the lines in the book.  I did remarks often in my own shorthand.  
I kept the grammer errors and so far have not found any programming that needed changing.

There is also a .PRG file for download along with a .txt file of the program exported
from Vice64.

If you see anything in my setup or use please feel free to message me.
